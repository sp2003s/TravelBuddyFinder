## About

Travel Buddy Finder is designed to address the challenges of solo travel, high costs, and missed opportunities for meaningful connections. 
Our platform was born out of a college project and personal experiences, where we realized the need for a solution that facilitates cost-sharing and enhances travel experiences.
Our inception was rooted in the academic halls of college. Travel Buddy Finder emerged as a college project, a brainchild born out of our collective passion for exploration and the genuine need we saw in the world of travel. 
We, the creators behind Travel Buddy Finder, were travelers ourselves, and we faced the same challenges you might be familiar with. 
The high costs of getting to the airport via a cab, the solitude of long train journeys, and the missed connections with fellow adventurers - these were the issues that inspired us to take action.

We understand that exploring new destinations is not just about reaching a destination but also about the journey itself. We recognize the challenges and limitations of solo travel, both in terms of expenses and the missed opportunities for meaningful connections.

Travel Buddy Finder is more than just a platform. It is a global network of travelers comes from all walks of life, backgrounds, and cultures.
Our platform provides the tools and resources necessary for travelers to plan and execute their trips with confidence and convenience.
